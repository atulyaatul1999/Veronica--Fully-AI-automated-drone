# Veronica--Fully-AI-automated-drone
- I used a Dji Tello drone and my computer vision skills to develop a program that could make a drone follow a human being by tracking his/her face, we can use this for surveillance of people carrying weapons.
- I used mediapipe Face mesh and haarcascade to detect human face and Wrote an algorithm to track a human face and automatically command drone to follow that person.
